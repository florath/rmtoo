.SH NAME
rmtoo-art-reqs-history-cnt \- requirements management tool: requirement 
history count
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rmtoo
requirement management tool is able to store the requirements in a
version control system.  Therefore it is possible to access the whole
history of requirements evolution.
.P
One simple application of this is to extract the number of
requirements during complete history of the project.
.P
With the help of the requirements history count module it is possible
to visualize the evolution of the requirements count.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration for this output module goes (as all other output
module's configuration) in the \fBoutput\fR section of the
configuration. 
.P
The key must be \fIstats_reqs_cnt\fR.  This must be
followed by a map containing one entry:
.P
.B output_filename
The filename where the output is written to.
.P
Example
.sp
.RS
.nf
        "stats_reqs_cnt": [
            {
                "output_filename": "artifacts/stats_reqs_cnt.csv"
            }
        ]

.SH POSTPROCESSING
The resulting file is a tabulator separated file. The first entry is
the point of time, the second the number of requirements.
Example line: 2010-10-06_08:29:14 158
.P
The contrib directory (located using rmtoo-contrib-dir command) contains an example file how to use the output
