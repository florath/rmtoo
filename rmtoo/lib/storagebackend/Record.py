       set.  Additionally to the data only (where mostly everything
       operates on) this class also stores the order of the tags and
       possible empty lines and / or comments.  Also the id is stored
       inside this object.
       There are (at least) two different access and usage methods:
       o tags must be unique and order does not matter.
       o tags need not be unique but order does matter.
       The first can easily be represented by a dictionary, the second by a
       list.'''
